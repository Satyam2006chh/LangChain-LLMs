🚀 LangChain Projects — AI Apps for Real-World Use Cases

A collection of powerful AI applications built using Python, Streamlit, Flask, LangChain, Hugging Face models, and modern LLMs.
This repo is designed to help you master LLM development, prompt engineering, multi-modal AI, and agent-driven workflows — all in one place.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo contains modular, real-world LangChain projects that demonstrate:

🔹 How to work with LLMs (open-source & API-based)

🔹 How to build interactive AI apps using Streamlit

🔹 How to integrate Flask backends with AI pipelines

🔹 How to use HuggingFace models (text + image + multi-modal)

🔹 How to implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

🔹 How to design chatbots, multimodal systems, and agents

🔹 How to build production-ready AI tools

All projects follow clean code practices and modern LangChain v0.2+ architecture using Runnables.
